    <ul>
        <li><strong>Web history:</strong> Tab URLs and titles are temporarily processed to manage tab-switching.</li>
        <li><strong>User activity:</strong> Tab switching behavior is tracked locally to provide the most recently used functionality.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        - No data is transmitted, stored remotely, or shared with any third party.<br>
        - All data is processed and stored locally on your device for the sole purpose of providing the core functionality of the extension.<br>
        - Data is cleared automatically when the browser is closed or the extension is disabled.
    </p>
    <h2>User Rights</h2>
